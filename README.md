Personal Use:
        
        most to deal with the situation that I crash the snapshot in all kinds of way.As well as taking notes for the environment.
        
Suggests:
        
        creat your own file,rather than this created by me ,a beginner,which is uncompleted and instable.

warning:

        using my private account in 'git config',may it be more fast,change if need. 
        the source chosen works and only works well in China ,mainland.But change it however. 
        don't kill me if you forget to take a snapshot.
